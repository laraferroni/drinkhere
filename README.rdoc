== Getting Started On Windows

You need to know if you are running a 32-bit or 64-bit version of Windows.  To find out, press +Windows-r+ and enter <tt>control.exe /name Microsoft.System</tt>

1.  Install +node+ - a javascript runtime for Windows from http://nodejs.org/download/ - you'll want the .msi for the right bit version of Windows. Just accept all of the default choices.

2.  Install a build of +postgres+ as our database.  You'll want <tt>version 9.2.9</tt> from http://www.enterprisedb.com/products-services-training/pgdownload#windows.  Choose +postgres+ as the password for the db, and there's no need to change the port from +5432+.  You can accept the rest of the defaults here.

3.  Install +atom+ - a reasonably good text editor for +Windows+ that works well with +rails+.  It is found at http://atom.io.

4.  Install +Rails+ itself.  We are using <tt>ruby 2.0</tt>.  So head over to the +RailsInstaller+ at http://railsinstaller.org, and click to download <tt>Windows Ruby 2.0</tt>. Run the installer, and accept the defaults.

5.  Configure your security (ssh) keys.  At the end of the +Rails+ install, you should see a message that says <tt>your public key has been copied to the clipboard</tt>.  You'll want to paste this into your +GitHub+ account at https://github.com/settings/ssh.  Just choose <tt>Add A Key</tt> and paste it in to the +Key+ field, and give it a title like "My Home PC"  When you paste it in, it should look something like:

      ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAADAQABAAABAQCmyN17vhmMyLxXlsSKdf0Po2enETp7Op8PAMq/NTQBllDw5I8ke6C76pPDPVeZoI+T7LxbUtUhWbHNNbkJRwYdaqb3CZ+fYWNGzBJACzevZbmXmBeEthox3X+3Al2yrGIud4Iagptqw2aIrE2gDTzkQPmrDLJnn5s05h7HuAOcD5iZ++nOXN9tACrmPRUvRIltQBnaM9xM7hRVALr8FrXjxM5P+ru9IJcgkWWjf263SCU8/+vveyYD8dYrSB3ToVbwtD9kULz3qo08ChqvJfOQErt/JKke/OHedYY28sYJqIzjmJoNd36RxJoni8BfMVpX1cFIlx/bFunuiXYb2CSt Cam Ferroni <cam@ferroni.net>

    If it doesn't, then you'll need to do the following.  In the <tt>command window</tt> you'll see a line just above the cursor that says something like:

      public_key_location: C:\Users\admin/.ssh/id_rsa.pub

    with +admin+ replaced by whatever username you use to log into windows. Type (without the >) into the command line:

      > atom C:\Users\_your_username_/.ssh/id_rsa.pub

    To load the file into +atom+, and then you should be able to copy all of it and paste it into GitHub.

6.  Install <tt>GitHub For Windows</tt> from http://windows.github.com.

    Once it is installed, you should be able to enter your credentials for +github+, hit the <tt>+</tt> sign, choose +Clone+, choose +laraferroni/drinkhere+, choose <tt>C:\Sites</tt> to clone it into.

7.  Install +ImageMagick+ from http://www.imagemagick.org/download/binaries/ImageMagick-6.9.0-4-Q16-x64-dll.exe

8.  Setup your +Hosts+ so that you can see the difference between the halepele and popehouse experience.

    You need to find +notepad+ on your machine - I went to the all applications area, and scrolled until I found it, and then right-clicked, and chose <tt>Run as Administrator</tt>.  If you don't run as administrator, you can't save this file.

    Once you are there, you need to open <tt>C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\Hosts</tt>.  You'll need to change the option from Text Files to All Files to see this file, since it doesn't end in .txt.

    Add these two lines to the end of the file:

      127.0.0.1 halepele.localhost.dev
      127.0.0.1 popehouse.localhost.dev

    And save it.

9.  Next, we need to make a few changes to your environment.

      > set SSL_CERT_FILE=C:\Sites\drinkhere\ssl_certs\cacert.pem

    You will need to do this every time you start the app, so you may want to add this to your global environment if you are comfortable doing so.

10. Setup your gems.  Make sure you are in the <tt>C:\Sites\drinkhere</tt> directory and type.

      > rm Gemfile.lock
      > bundle install

11. Setup your database.

      > rake db:reset

12. You should be ready to rock.  Run <tt>rails s<tt> from the drinkhere directory.

    In a browser, you can now go to these 3 places:

      http://localhost:3000                 # The Main Admin site
      http://halepele.localhost.dev:3000    # The Hale Pele specific site
      http://popehouse.localhost.dev:3000   # The Pope House specific site

    And to login as admin, there are the following accounts:

      admin@halepele.com  pw: changeme
      admin@popehouse.com pw: changeme
